## Generate the samples

```bash
# From the repo root - requires the .venv with pyttsx3 installed
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1          # Windows
python samples/audio/generate_samples.py
```

## Notes

- WAV files are **not committed** to the repo (listed in `.gitignore`). Run the script above to regenerate them.
- The script uses **Microsoft David** (US English) voice at 160 WPM for clear transcription results.
- All scenarios reference products from [`zava-creative-writer-local/src/api/agents/writer/products.json`](../../zava-creative-writer-local/src/api/agents/writer/products.json).
