# Part 11: Tool Calling with Local Models

> **Goal:** Enable your local model to call external functions (tools) so it can retrieve real-time data, perform calculations, or interact with APIs — all running privately on your device.

## What Is Tool Calling?

Tool calling (also known as **function calling**) lets a language model request the execution of functions you define. Instead of guessing an answer, the model recognises when a tool would help and returns a structured request for your code to execute. Your application runs the function, sends the result back, and the model incorporates that information into its final response.

![Tool-calling flow](../images/tool-calling-flow.svg)

This pattern is essential for building agents that can:

- **Look up live data** (weather, stock prices, database queries)
- **Perform precise calculations** (maths, unit conversions)
- **Take actions** (send emails, create tickets, update records)
- **Access private systems** (internal APIs, file systems)

---

## How Tool Calling Works

The tool-calling flow has four stages:

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Define tools** | You describe available functions using JSON Schema — name, description, and parameters |
| **2. Model decides** | The model receives your message plus the tool definitions. If a tool would help, it returns a `tool_calls` response instead of a text answer |
| **3. Execute locally** | Your code parses the tool call, runs the function, and collects the result |
| **4. Final answer** | You send the tool result back to the model, which produces its final response |

> **Key point:** The model never executes code. It only *requests* that a tool be called. Your application decides whether to honour that request — this keeps you in full control.

---

## Which Models Support Tool Calling?

Not every model supports tool calling. In the current Foundry Local catalogue, the following models have tool-calling capability:

| Model | Size | Tool Calling |
|-------|------|:---:|
| qwen2.5-0.5b | 822 MB | ✅ |
| qwen2.5-1.5b | 1.8 GB | ✅ |
| qwen2.5-7b | 6.3 GB | ✅ |
| qwen2.5-14b | 11.3 GB | ✅ |
| qwen2.5-coder-0.5b | 822 MB | ✅ |
| qwen2.5-coder-1.5b | 1.8 GB | ✅ |
| qwen2.5-coder-7b | 6.3 GB | ✅ |
| qwen2.5-coder-14b | 11.3 GB | ✅ |
| phi-4-mini | 4.6 GB | ✅ |
| phi-3.5-mini | 2.6 GB | ❌ |
| phi-4 | 10.4 GB | ❌ |

> **Tip:** For this lab we use **qwen2.5-0.5b** — it is small (822 MB download), fast, and has reliable tool-calling support.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1 — Understand the Tool-Calling Flow

Before writing code, study this sequence diagram:

![Tool-calling sequence diagram](../images/tool-calling-sequence.svg)

**Key observations:**

1. You define the tools upfront as JSON Schema objects
2. The model's response contains `tool_calls` instead of regular content
3. Each tool call has a unique `id` you must reference when returning results
4. The model sees all previous messages *plus* the tool results when generating the final answer
5. Multiple tool calls can happen in a single response

> **Discussion:** Why does the model return tool calls rather than executing functions directly? What security advantages does this provide?

---

### Exercise 2 — Defining Tool Schemas

Tools are defined using the standard OpenAI function-calling format. Each tool needs:

- **`type`**: Always `"function"`
- **`function.name`**: A descriptive function name (e.g. `get_weather`)
- **`function.description`**: A clear description — the model uses this to decide when to call the tool
- **`function.parameters`**: A JSON Schema object describing the expected arguments

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get the current weather for a given city",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "city": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The city name, e.g. London"
        }
      },
      "required": ["city"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Best practices for tool descriptions:**
> - Be specific: "Get the current weather for a given city" is better than "Get weather"
> - Describe parameters clearly: the model reads these descriptions to fill in the right values
> - Mark required vs optional parameters — this helps the model decide what to ask for

---

### Exercise 3 — Run the Tool-Calling Examples

Each language sample defines two tools (`get_weather` and `get_population`), sends a question that triggers tool use, executes the tool locally, and sends the result back for a final answer.

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
cd python
python -m venv venv

# Windows (PowerShell):
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS / Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run:**
```bash
python foundry-local-tool-calling.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
Starting Foundry Local service...
User: What is the weather like in London?

Model requested 1 tool call(s):
  → get_weather({'city': 'London'})

Final response:
The current weather in London is 18°C and partly cloudy.
```

**Code walkthrough** (`python/foundry-local-tool-calling.py`):

```python
# Define tools as a list of function schemas
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather for a given city",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "city": {"type": "string", "description": "The city name"}
                },
                "required": ["city"]
            }
        }
    }
]

# Send with tools — the model may return tool_calls instead of content
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model_id,
    messages=messages,
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="auto",
)

# Check if the model wants to call a tool
if response.choices[0].message.tool_calls:
    # Execute the tool and send the result back
    ...
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🟨 JavaScript (Node.js)</strong></summary>

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
cd javascript
npm install
```

**Run:**
```bash
node foundry-local-tool-calling.mjs
```

**Expected output:**
```
Starting Foundry Local service...
User: What is the weather like in London?

Model requested 1 tool call(s):
  → get_weather({"city":"London"})

Final response:
The current weather in London is 18°C and partly cloudy.
```

**Code walkthrough** (`javascript/foundry-local-tool-calling.mjs`):

This example uses the native Foundry Local SDK's `ChatClient` rather than the OpenAI SDK, demonstrating the convenience `createChatClient()` method:

```javascript
// Get a ChatClient directly from the model object
const chatClient = model.createChatClient();

// Send with tools — ChatClient handles the OpenAI-compatible format
const response = await chatClient.completeChat(messages, tools);
const assistantMessage = response.choices[0].message;

// Check for tool calls
if (assistantMessage.tool_calls && assistantMessage.tool_calls.length > 0) {
    // Execute tools and send results back
    ...
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🟦 C# (.NET)</strong></summary>

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
cd csharp
dotnet restore
```

**Run:**
```bash
dotnet run toolcall
```

**Expected output:**
```
Starting Foundry Local service...
Loading model: qwen2.5-0.5b...
User: What is the weather like in London?

Model requested 1 tool call(s):
  → get_weather({"city":"London"})

Final response:
The current weather in London is 18°C and partly cloudy.
```

**Code walkthrough** (`csharp/ToolCalling.cs`):

C# uses the `ChatTool.CreateFunctionTool` helper to define tools:

```csharp
ChatTool getWeatherTool = ChatTool.CreateFunctionTool(
    functionName: "get_weather",
    functionDescription: "Get the current weather for a given city",
    functionParameters: BinaryData.FromString("""
    {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "city": { "type": "string", "description": "The city name" }
        },
        "required": ["city"]
    }
    """));

var options = new ChatCompletionOptions();
options.Tools.Add(getWeatherTool);

// Check FinishReason to see if tools were called
if (completion.Value.FinishReason == ChatFinishReason.ToolCalls)
{
    // Execute tools and send results back
    ...
}
```

</details>

---

### Exercise 4 — The Tool-Calling Conversation Flow

Understanding the message structure is critical. Here is the complete flow, showing the `messages` array at each stage:

**Stage 1 — Initial request:**
```json
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Use the provided tools."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in London?"}
]
```

**Stage 2 — Model responds with tool_calls (not content):**
```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "id": "call_abc123",
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "arguments": "{\"city\": \"London\"}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Stage 3 — You add the assistant message AND the tool result:**
```json
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "..."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in London?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [...]},
  {
    "role": "tool",
    "tool_call_id": "call_abc123",
    "content": "{\"city\": \"London\", \"temperature\": \"18°C\", \"condition\": \"Partly cloudy\"}"
  }
]
```

**Stage 4 — Model produces the final answer using the tool result.**

> **Important:** The `tool_call_id` in the tool message must match the `id` from the tool call. This is how the model associates results with requests.

---

### Exercise 5 — Multiple Tool Calls

A model can request several tool calls in a single response. Try changing the user message to trigger multiple calls:

```python
# In Python — change the user message:
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Use the provided tools to answer questions."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather and population of London?"},
]
```

```javascript
// In JavaScript — change the user message:
const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant. Use the provided tools to answer questions." },
  { role: "user", content: "What is the weather and population of London?" },
];
```

The model should return two `tool_calls` — one for `get_weather` and one for `get_population`. Your code already handles this because it loops through all tool calls.

> **Try it:** Modify the user message and run the sample again. Does the model call both tools?

---

### Exercise 6 — Add Your Own Tool

Extend one of the samples with a new tool. For example, add a `get_time` tool:

1. Define the tool schema:
```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "get_time",
    "description": "Get the current time in a given city's timezone",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "city": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The city name, e.g. Tokyo"
        }
      },
      "required": ["city"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Add the execution logic:
```python
# Python
def execute_tool(name, arguments):
    if name == "get_time":
        city = arguments.get("city", "Unknown")
        # In a real app, use a timezone library
        return json.dumps({"city": city, "time": "14:30 GMT"})
    # ... existing tools ...
```

3. Add the tool to the `tools` array and test with: "What time is it in Tokyo?"

> **Challenge:** Add a tool that performs a calculation, such as `convert_temperature` that converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Test it with: "Convert 100°F to Celsius."

---

### Exercise 7 — Tool Calling with the SDK's ChatClient (JavaScript)

The JavaScript sample already uses the SDK's native `ChatClient` instead of the OpenAI SDK. This is a convenience feature that removes the need to construct an OpenAI client yourself:

```javascript
import { FoundryLocalManager } from "foundry-local-sdk";

// ChatClient is created directly from the model object
const model = await manager.catalog.getModel("qwen2.5-0.5b");
await model.load();
const chatClient = model.createChatClient();

// completeChat accepts tools as a second parameter
const response = await chatClient.completeChat(messages, tools);
```

Compare this with the Python approach which uses the OpenAI SDK explicitly:

```python
client = openai.OpenAI(base_url=manager.endpoint, api_key=manager.api_key)
response = client.chat.completions.create(model=model_id, messages=messages, tools=tools)
```

Both patterns are valid. The `ChatClient` is more convenient; the OpenAI SDK gives you access to the full range of OpenAI parameters.

> **Try it:** Modify the JavaScript sample to use the OpenAI SDK instead of `ChatClient`. You will need `import OpenAI from "openai"` and construct the client with the endpoint from `manager.urls[0]`.

---

### Exercise 8 — Understanding tool_choice

The `tool_choice` parameter controls whether the model *must* use a tool or can choose freely:

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `"auto"` | Model decides whether to call a tool (default) |
| `"none"` | Model will not call any tools, even if provided |
| `"required"` | Model must call at least one tool |
| `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_weather"}}` | Model must call the specified tool |

Try each option in the Python sample:

```python
# Force the model to call get_weather
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model_id,
    messages=messages,
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice={"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_weather"}},
)
```

> **Note:** Not all `tool_choice` options may be supported by every model. If a model does not support `"required"`, it may ignore the setting and behave as `"auto"`.

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Model never calls tools | Ensure you are using a tool-calling model (e.g. qwen2.5-0.5b). Check the table above. |
| `tool_call_id` mismatch | Always use the `id` from the tool call response, not a hardcoded value |
| Model returns malformed JSON in `arguments` | Smaller models occasionally produce invalid JSON. Wrap `JSON.parse()` in a try/catch |
| Model calls a tool that does not exist | Add a default handler in your `execute_tool` function |
| Infinite tool-calling loop | Set a maximum number of rounds (e.g. 5) to prevent runaway loops |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Tool calling** lets models request function execution rather than guessing answers
2. The model **never executes code** — your application decides what to run
3. Tools are defined as **JSON Schema** objects following the OpenAI function-calling format
4. The conversation uses a **multi-turn pattern**: user → assistant (tool_calls) → tool (results) → assistant (final answer)
5. Always use a **model that supports tool calling** (Qwen 2.5, Phi-4-mini)
6. The SDK's `createChatClient()` provides a convenient way to make tool-calling requests without constructing an OpenAI client
