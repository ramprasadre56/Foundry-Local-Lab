"""
Foundry Local — Multi-Agent Workflow with Microsoft Agent Framework

Demonstrates a multi-agent pipeline running entirely on-device using
FoundryLocalClient:
  1. Researcher agent  — gathers background information
  2. Writer agent      — drafts an article from the research
  3. Editor agent      — reviews and provides feedback

Each agent has its own system instructions and persona. The agents
collaborate sequentially: Researcher → Writer → Editor.
