# Foundry Local Workshop - Build AI Apps On-Device

A hands-on workshop for running language models on your own machine and building intelligent applications with [Foundry Local](https://foundrylocal.ai) and the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/).

> **What is Foundry Local?** Foundry Local is a lightweight runtime that lets you download, manage, and serve language models entirely on your hardware. It exposes an **OpenAI-compatible API** so any tool or SDK that speaks OpenAI can connect - no cloud account required.
