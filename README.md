# Foundry Local Workshop — Build AI Apps On-Device

A hands-on workshop for running language models on your own machine and building intelligent applications with [Foundry Local](https://foundrylocal.ai) and the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/).

> **What is Foundry Local?** Foundry Local is a lightweight runtime that lets you download, manage, and serve language models entirely on your hardware. It exposes an **OpenAI-compatible API** so any tool or SDK that speaks OpenAI can connect — no cloud account required.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop you will be able to:

| # | Objective |
|---|-----------|
| 1 | Install Foundry Local and manage models with the CLI |
| 2 | Connect to the local inference server using the Python, JavaScript, and C# SDKs |
| 3 | Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that grounds answers in your own data |
| 4 | Create AI agents with persistent instructions and personas |
| 5 | Orchestrate multi-agent workflows with feedback loops |
| 6 | Explore a production capstone app — the Contoso Creative Writer |

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Hardware** | 8 GB RAM minimum (16 GB recommended); AVX2-capable CPU or a supported GPU |
| **OS** | Windows 10/11 (x64/ARM), Windows Server 2025, or macOS 13+ |
| **Foundry Local CLI** | Install via `winget install Microsoft.FoundryLocal` (Windows) or `brew install foundrylocal` (macOS). See the [getting started guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-local/get-started) for details. |
