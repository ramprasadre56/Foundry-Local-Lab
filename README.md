# Foundry Local Workshop - Build AI Apps On-Device

A hands-on workshop for running language models on your own machine and building intelligent applications with [Foundry Local](https://foundrylocal.ai) and the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/).

> **What is Foundry Local?** Foundry Local is a lightweight runtime that lets you download, manage, and serve language models entirely on your hardware. It exposes an **OpenAI-compatible API** so any tool or SDK that speaks OpenAI can connect - no cloud account required.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop you will be able to:

| # | Objective |

| 2 | Master the Foundry Local SDK API for programmatic model management |
| 3 | Connect to the local inference server using the Python, JavaScript, and C# SDKs |
| 4 | Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that grounds answers in your own data |
| 5 | Create AI agents with persistent instructions and personas |
| 6 | Orchestrate multi-agent workflows with feedback loops |
| 7 | Explore a production capstone app - the Zava Creative Writer |
| 8 | Transcribe audio with Whisper - speech-to-text on-device using the Foundry Local SDK |

- Python, JavaScript, and C# tracks with `client.audio.transcriptions.create()` (Python/JS) and `AudioClient.TranscribeAudioAsync()` (C#)
- Includes Zava-themed sample audio files for hands-on practice

> **Note:** This lab uses the **Foundry Local SDK** to programmatically download and load the Whisper model, then sends audio to the local OpenAI-compatible endpoint for transcription. The Whisper model (`whisper`) is listed in the Foundry Local catalog and runs entirely on-device - no cloud API keys or network access required.
